# asd1025-relayed
Input selection circuit replacing the ASD-1015 motor switch in Pioneer's A-502R amplifier using relays.

## Supported amplifiers
This circuit board is designed to replace ASD-1025 in the Pioneer A-502R amplifier. Since the ASD-1025 was also used in A-503R and A-602R, it may be possible to use it in these models as well, but this has not been verified.
